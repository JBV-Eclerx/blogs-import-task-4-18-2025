Since our founding in 2002, our team of directors and surveyors has been dedicated to offering the highest standard of service to clients across the Sunshine Coast, Brisbane, and Kingaroy. In this article, we will explore the importance of boundary surveys for property owners. Emphasising the need for accurate boundary determination to prevent disputes, understand property rights, and make informed decisions regarding land use, development, and property transactions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Boundary Surveys Matter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accurate boundary determination is vital for property owners. A boundary survey precisely identifies the property lines and establishes legal boundaries. By conducting a thorough boundary survey, you can avoid potential disputes with neighbors over encroachments and ensure that your rights are protected. Understanding the exact location of your property boundaries is crucial when making decisions about land use, construction projects, and property improvements. Additionally, when engaging in property transactions, having a verified boundary survey provides confidence to buyers and lenders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Boundary Survey Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The boundary survey process involves several key steps that our experienced surveyors at ONF Surveyors follow diligently. We begin by researching historical records, deeds, and surveys related to the property. This information helps establish a baseline for the survey.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/fieldwork"&gt;Fieldwork&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is then conducted, utilising advanced equipment such as total stations and GPS technology to accurately measure and mark the boundaries. Our surveyors also consider physical markers, existing structures, and natural features to ensure precise boundary determination. Finally, we compile the collected data into a comprehensive survey plan, including boundary markers, and any relevant information for future reference.&lt;/p&gt;
